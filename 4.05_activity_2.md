# 4.05 Activity 2

If you think a little bit about it, the number of neighbors might be very important for our results, but will it be the only parameter that matters? Go to the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) and check the parameters and the values they can take, pick the one you think is more relevant and change its value in the model.
**Hint**: If `K` (number of neighbors) is the most important one, maybe we could measure the way these `K` instances affect our prediction.
