# 4.05 Activity 1

Refer to the `files_for_activities/lesson_4.05_data.csv` file.

1. Fit a linear regression model on the same processed data. Note we have already performed basic cleaning operations, data preprocessing - scaling and encoding, and then the train test split. Fit the model on the training data directly.
2. Find the accuracy of the model using the test data.
3. Compare the accuracies of linear regression and the `KNN` model.
